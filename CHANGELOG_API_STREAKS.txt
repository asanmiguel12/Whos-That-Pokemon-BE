Change Log - PokemonController.java
===================================

Date: 2025-07-03

1. Added API endpoint to log highest streaks:
   - POST /api/pokemon/logStreak
   - Accepts 'username' and 'streak' as request parameters.
   - Reads or creates 'streaks.txt' to store highest streaks per user in the format 'username:streak'.
   - Updates the user's streak only if the new streak is higher than the previous one.
   - Handles file reading, updating, and writing logic.

2. Added API endpoint to retrieve all highest streaks:
   - GET /api/pokemon/highestStreaks
   - Reads 'streaks.txt' and returns a map of usernames to their highest streaks.

3. Fixed for-each loop for writing streaks:
   - Replaced 'var' with 'Map.Entry<String, Integer>' for compatibility.
   - Used 'entry.getKey()' and 'entry.getValue()' to avoid IDE errors.

4. General error handling and input validation:
   - Added checks for null/empty usernames and negative streaks.
   - Added try-catch blocks for file operations.

All changes are in 'PokemonController.java'.
